= TODO
List of things to do:
- Find a better way to hide the file list and use the same way to hide
  the terminals. Patches for this are welcome!
- Configurable shortcut keys: allow users to change the shortcut keys
  with .vimmaterc. Need to find a way to specify the modifier (shift, ctrl)
  and the key. Probably something like "CONTROL_MASK SHIFT_MASK GDK_S".

= Ideas
- New from file copy
- Opening many files at once
- Open in external viewer
